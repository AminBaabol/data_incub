Challenge questions for The Data Incubator

1) Run [Challenge.ipynb](notebooks/Challenge.ipynb) for challenge questions 1 and 2.
2) Run [Project.ipynb](notebooks/Project.ipynb) for challenge question 3, the project proposal.

Images generated by [Challenge.ipynb](notebooks/Challenge.ipynb) are displayed inline in the IPython notebooks, while images generated by [Project.ipynb](notebooks/Project.ipynb) are displayed both inline and as .png files in the [imgs](imgs) directory.

Thank you, and enjoy!
